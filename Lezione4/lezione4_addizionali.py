#School Grading System:

#Create a function that takes a student's name and their scores in different subjects as input.
#The function calculates the average score and prints the student's name, average, and a message indicating whether the student passed the exam 
#(average >= 60) or failed.
#Create a for loop to iterate over 
# a list of students and scores, calling the function for each student.
def student_score( student_name: str, score: list) -> None:
    average_score = sum(score) / len(score)     

    if average_score >= 60:
        print(f"\tStudent: {student_name} has passed the exam with an average score of: {average_score:.2f}")
    else:
        print(f"\tStudent: {student_name} has not passed the exam.")

students: list = ["Leonardo", "Matteo", "Bruno"]
scores: list = [[77, 89, 96], [30, 69, 72], [78, 90, 63]]

for student, score in zip(students, scores):
    student_score(student_name=student, score=score)


#2. Guess the Number Game:

#Create a function that generates a random number within a range specified by the user.
#Prompt the user to guess the number within a specified maximum number of attempts.
#Provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
#Terminate the loop when the user guesses the number correctly or reaches the maximum number of attempts.


#3. E-commerce Shopping Cart:

#Create a function that defines a product with a name, price, and quantity.
#     Create a function that manages the shopping cart, allowing the user to add, remove, and view products in the cart.
#   The function should calculate the cart total and apply any discounts or taxes.
#     Implement a for loop to iterate over the items in the cart and print detailed information about each product and the total.

#4. Text Analysis:

#     Create a function that reads a text file and counts the number of occurrences of each word.
#    The function should print a report showing the most frequent words and their number of occurrences.
#    You can use a for loop to iterate over the words in the text and a dictionary to store the occurrences.
#    Implement error handling to handle missing files or other input issues.


#5. Inventory Management System:

#     Create a function that defines an item with a code, name, quantity, and price.
#     Create a database or dictionary to store the items in inventory.
#    Implement functions to add, remove, search, and update items in the inventory.
#    Use for loops and conditional statements to manage the various inventory operations.

#6. Password Generator:

#    Create a function that generates a random password with a specified length and desired character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols).
#    Allow the user to specify the password length and desired character types.
#    Generate and return a random password that meets the user's criteria.

#7. Roman Numeral Conversion:

#    Create a function that converts a given integer to its Roman numeral representation.
#    Handle numbers from 1 to 3999.
#    Use a combination of string manipulation and conditional statements to build the Roman numeral.

#8. ATM Machine Simulator:

#    Create a function that simulates an ATM machine.
#    Initialize an account with a starting balance.
#    Allow the user to perform transactions such as deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
#     Validate transactions against the account balance and available funds.
#    Provide appropriate feedback to the user for each transaction.


#9. Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

#    Create functions for encrypting and decrypting a message using the Caesar cipher.
#    Allow the user to specify the shift value (number of positions to shift each letter).
#    Handle both encryption and decryption using the same function with appropriate adjustments.
#    Encrypt and decrypt the given message using the specified shift value.


#10. Anagram Checker:

#    Create a function that checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other.
#    Convert both strings to lowercase and remove any non-alphabetic characters.
#    Sort the characters of each string and compare the sorted strings for equality.
#    Indicate whether the strings are anagrams or not.

#11. Word Search Puzzle Solver:

#    Create a function that solves a word search puzzle.
#    Provide a 2D grid representing the puzzle and a list of words to find.
#    Implement a backtracking algorithm to search for the words in the grid, marking visited cells to avoid repetition.
#    Output the locations of the found words within the grid.


#12. Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Number Generator:

#    Create a function that generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
#    Initialize an array of all numbers up to the limit, marking each number as prime initially.
#    Iterate through the array, starting from 2, and mark every multiple of the current number as non-prime.
#    The remaining unmarked numbers are the prime numbers within the limit.
#    Return the list of prime numbers.


#13. Fractal Tree Generator:

#    Create a function that generates a fractal tree using recursion.
#    Specify the starting trunk length and branching angle.
#    Draw the trunk and then recursively call the function to draw two branches at the specified angle, each with a shorter length.
#    Repeat the branching process until a desired level of detail is reached.


#14. Sudoku Solver:

#    Create a function that solves a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
#    Provide a 9x9 grid representing the puzzle with some numbers filled in and others left blank.
#    Implement a backtracking algorithm to check for valid placements in empty cells, ensuring no row, column, or 3x3 subgrid contains duplicates.
#    Solve the puzzle by filling in the remaining empty cells with valid numbers.

#15. Text Editor with Basic Functionality:

#    Create a simple text editor that allows the user to open, edit, and save text files.
#    Implement basic functionality such as inserting, deleting, and copying text.
#    Provide undo/redo functionality to allow users to reverse actions.
#    Save the edited text to a file when the user chooses to save.
