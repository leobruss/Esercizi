#Write a function that accepts a list of sentences (string) as input and returns each line as output after capitalising all sentence characters. For example:

#Write a function to check whether a string is a pangram or not. Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
#Input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
#Output: True


#Write a function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not. In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). For example:
#Input: 6
#Output: True


#Using the code implemented in Exercise 8, write a function that, given a number n as input, computes all "Perfect" numbers between 1 and n. For example:
#Input: 500
#Output: [6, 28, 496]


#Write a function to sort the (name, age, height) input list of tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The function should return a list of tuples of strings. The priority is that name > age > score. Namely, the sort criteria are:
#Sort based on name;
#Then, sort based on age;
#Then, sort by score.
#Input: [('Tom',19,80), ('John',20,90), ('Jony',17,91), ('Jony',17,93), ('Json',21,85)]
#Output:  [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
